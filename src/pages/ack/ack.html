            <p>   
                My sincerest appreciation goes out to Professor Hamid Laga and students Andrew Graham,  Daniel Hayden Kearsley, Eli Carter,  Mike Gomes Camara and Taaqif Peck who developed this app from the bare concept I initially provided. Without their collaboration, skills, tactful suggestions and dedication this app would not exist.

                Many thanks also to Verena Edwards for her skilful reimagining of the Talkable logo and custom icons used throughout the app.

                Thank you also to The City of Melville and the Project Robin Hood grant scheme for supporting Talkable and helping to highlight the importance of language learning in the early years.

                Thanks to my friends and family for being my test pilots and biggest fans. And finally a huge thank you to Dan, Ella and Chloe for being my inspiration, cheerleaders, and subject matter for this two year project - I couldn't have done it without you.
