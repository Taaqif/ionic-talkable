    <h2>About the App</h2>
    <p>The Talkable app is a 10 week program that aims to give all parents the skills they need to create a rich language learning environment at home. It is not intended to replace individual assessment and treatment by a speech pathologist that may be necessary for children with speech and language difficulties. If you have ongoing concerns about your child's development please speak to your GP or child health nurse. 
      </p> 
    <h2>About Karen</h2>
    <p>In case you haven’t figured it out yet, I’m passionate about early language development and the real difference that every parent can make when it comes to teaching their child to communicate. I’ve been a paediatric speech pathologist for over 12 years, working in both Melbourne and Perth.
    
    </p> <p>I currently work part-time for a not-for-profit parenting support organisation in Perth, which I love. My other, and most important job, is being Mum to my two beautiful girls Ella and Chloe.
    </p>
    <p>For more information, videos and tip sheets head to www.talkable.org.au. If you have any questions I’d love to hear from you so send me an email at karen@talkable.org.au.

    <h2>About Talkable</h2>
    <p>Talkable is a social enterprise aiming to help all parents raise Talkable toddlers. It receives funding through grants, sponsorship and some fee-for-service programs. This model allows Talkable to offer support and expert advice to parents at low or no cost. 
    </p> 
    <p>To date, Talkable has collaborated with the local government as well as many childcare centres and early parenting services in Perth, training both parents and educators in the best ways to foster early language learning.
