  <h2>About the App</h2>
  <p>The Talkable app is a 10 week program that aims to give all parents the skills they need to create a rich language learning
    environment at home. It is not intended to replace individual assessment and treatment by a speech pathologist that may
    be necessary for children with speech and language difficulties. If you have ongoing concerns about your child's development
    please speak to your GP or child health nurse.
  </p>
  <h2>About Karen</h2>
  <p>In case you haven’t figured it out yet, I’m passionate about early language development and the real difference that every
    parent can make when it comes to teaching their child to communicate. I’ve been a paediatric speech pathologist for over
    12 years, working in both Melbourne and Perth.

  </p>
  <p>I currently work part-time for a not-for-profit parenting support organisation in Perth, which I love. My other, and most
    important job, is being Mum to my two beautiful girls Ella and Chloe.
  </p>
  <p>For more information, videos and tip sheets head to www.talkable.org.au. If you have any questions I’d love to hear from
    you so send me an email at karen@talkable.org.au.
  </p>
  <h2>About Talkable</h2>
  <p>Talkable is a social enterprise aiming to help all parents raise Talkable toddlers. It receives funding through grants,
    sponsorship and some fee-for-service programs. This model allows Talkable to offer support and expert advice to parents
    at low or no cost.
  </p>
  <p>To date, Talkable has collaborated with the local government as well as many childcare centres and early parenting services
    in Perth, training both parents and educators in the best ways to foster early language learning.

  <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>
    My sincerest appreciation goes out to Professor Hamid Laga and students Andrew Graham, Daniel Hayden Kearsley, Eli Carter,
    Mike Gomes Camara and Taaqif Peck who developed this app from the bare concept I initially provided. Without their collaboration,
    skills, tactful suggestions and dedication this app would not exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many thanks also to Verena Edwards for her skilful reimagining of the Talkable logo and custom icons used throughout the
    app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you also to The City of Melville and the Project Robin Hood grant scheme for supporting Talkable and helping to highlight
    the importance of language learning in the early years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to my friends and family for being my test pilots and biggest fans. And finally a huge thank you to Dan, Ella and
    Chloe for being my inspiration, cheerleaders, and subject matter for this two year project - I couldn't have done it
    without you.

  </p>
